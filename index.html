	<h1> What to Look For In A Drum Set</h1><br>
	<p> When looking for a drum set, it is important to figure out first how many drums and cymbals you want the set
		  to include. Next, there are many different types of wood that can be used to make a drum set such as birch, maple,
		  African mahogany, and Oak to name a few.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Electronic Drum Sets </h1>
	<br>
	<p>In addition to acoustic drum sets, there are also electronic drum sets. Electronic drum sets are better in a place
		that does not allow loud music. You can simply plug in headphones into the mixer and play the drums quietly. I'll
		bet you did not think that was possible!</p>
